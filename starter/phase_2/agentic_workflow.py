#   2. Initialize an empty list to store 'completed_steps'.
#   3. Loop through the extracted workflow steps:
#      a. For each step, use the 'routing_agent' to route the step to the appropriate support function.
#      b. Append the result to 'completed_steps'.
#      c. Print information about the step being executed and its result.
#   4. After the loop, print the final output of the workflow (the last completed step).
